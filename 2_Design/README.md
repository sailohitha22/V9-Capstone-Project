# Design of the "Utilizing ZYNQ 7000 SOC for Automated Plant Disease Detection" Project
# Modified title: ZYNQ-Disease Detect: Precision Agriculture Solutions and Comparative Studies with AI Technologies
# High-Level Design:
The high-level design focuses on the overall architecture and approach of the system:

- System Overview: The project integrates advanced image processing algorithms with real-time processing capabilities using the ZYNQ 7000 SoC (System on Chip). The key goal is to detect plant diseases by analyzing leaf patterns and identifying early symptoms of disease.
- Key Components:
- Image Processing: MATLAB is used to develop and test algorithms like Otsu’s method and K-means clustering for edge detection and segmentation of diseased areas on leaves.
- ZYNQ 7000 SoC: This platform is chosen for its robust parallel processing capabilities, allowing real-time analysis of high-resolution crop images.
- Sensors and Cameras: High-resolution cameras are integrated to capture images, which are then processed by the system to detect diseases.
- Modular Design: The system is designed with a modular approach, ensuring easy upgrades and integration of new algorithms or hardware without extensive redesigns.
- Edge AI Integration: By incorporating edge AI technology, the system processes data 
locally on the device, reducing reliance on cloud servers and ensuring rapid analysis 
even in areas with limited connectivity. This integration also enhances data privacy and 
system reliability in field conditions.

# Low-Level Design:
The low-level design outlines specific components and their interactions:

- MATLAB Algorithm Development:
- Edge Detection: Otsu’s method is used to identify the boundaries of diseased areas by applying thresholding techniques.
- K-means Clustering: This technique segments images based on color intensities, isolating affected regions of the leaves.
- System Integration: After developing and testing the algorithms in MATLAB, they are ported to the ZYNQ 7000 SoC, where they are optimized for real-time execution.
- Real-Time Processing: The system ensures that image processing occurs within a time frame of under 1 second, providing rapid feedback to farmers for timely intervention.
