### **High-Level Requirements (HLR)**

1. **Early Disease Detection**  
   - The system should detect plant diseases at an early stage by identifying small changes in leaf patterns, color, or texture.

2. **Real-Time Processing**  
   - Use the ZYNQ 7000 SoC to quickly process images and videos of plants, giving results within 1 second.

3. **AI-Based Classification**  
   - Develop simple AI models to classify plant diseases accurately after processing the images.

4. **Work in Different Environments**  
   - The system must work well in different conditions like varying light, weather, and for different types of crops.

5. **Handle Large Farms**  
   - Design the system to monitor many crops and fields, making it useful for both small and large farms.

6. **Compare Methods**  
   - Check how well the system works compared to older methods of disease detection, focusing on speed and accuracy.

7. **Extra Diagnostics**  
   - Add features to detect other issues like pests or lack of nutrients in crops.

8. **Easy to Use**  
   - Make the system simple for farmers to use, even if they don’t have technical knowledge.

### **Low-Level Requirements (LLR)**

1. **Build Detection Algorithms**  
   - Create and test methods like Otsu’s method, Canny edge detection, and K-means clustering to separate healthy and diseased areas.

2. **Use ZYNQ 7000 SoC**  
   - Transfer the tested algorithms to the ZYNQ 7000 SoC to run them faster and more efficiently.

3. **Add Camera and Sensors**  
   - Use good-quality cameras and sensors to capture clear images and videos of plants.

4. **AI Model Integration**  
   - Train and add simple AI models for identifying plant diseases based on processed images.

5. **Quick Processing**  
   - Ensure that the system processes and gives results in less than 1 second.

6. **Test in Fields**  
   - Test the system on real farms to ensure it works well and adjust it if needed.

7. **Improve Performance**  
   - Make the system faster and more efficient to handle bigger farms or more data.

8. **Check with Older Methods**  
   - Compare the system’s performance with older techniques to see if it’s better.

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

1. **Fast Response**  
   - The system should give results quickly without delays.

2. **Low Power Use**  
   - The system must work efficiently, even in areas where electricity is limited.

3. **Strong and Reliable**  
   - It should work well in tough environments like dusty or hot farms.

4. **Simple to Operate**  
   - The interface should be easy for farmers to use without needing extra training.

5. **Expandable**  
   - The system should be able to cover larger areas and add new features easily.

6. **Eco-Friendly**  
   - Help reduce the use of harmful chemicals by identifying diseases early.

7. **Data Safety**  
   - Process information on-site to keep data secure and private.

8. **Affordable**  
   - Make the system cost-effective so farmers with smaller budgets can also use it.
